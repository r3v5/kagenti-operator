This file provides guidance for AI assistants working with this repository.

## Commit Attribution Policy

When creating git commits, do NOT use `Co-Authored-By` trailers for AI attribution.
Instead, use `Assisted-By` to acknowledge AI assistance without inflating contributor stats:

    Assisted-By: Claude (Anthropic AI) <noreply@anthropic.com>

Never add `Co-authored-by`, `Made-with`, or similar trailers that GitHub parses as co-authorship.

A `commit-msg` hook in `scripts/hooks/commit-msg` enforces this automatically.
Install it via pre-commit:

```sh
pre-commit install --hook-type pre-commit --hook-type commit-msg
```
